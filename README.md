# Ruin-game-simulaton

First calculate the probability p.b which means the probability that player B will ruin player A for p = 1/2.
Then I do the approximate calculation of p.b: The probability that B will ruin A for p = 0.1.
Finally I calculate m.b: Expected time in which B ruins A for p = 1/2 and for p = 0.1
